# Data Structures/Algorithms

## Simple interactive demos using React / Redux / D3.js
* Traveling Salesman
  * Custom solution using the nearest neighbor algorithm once per city as the origin
  * This improves the accuracy over a single run of NN
  * Complexity is O(n^2), memoized down to around O(n * (n - 1))
  * This implementation follows real roadways, so the path between two cities can pass through other cities. If a city is added that is already covered by an existing path, the NN algorithm is skipped and the new city is simply added to the existing tour.
* Binary Search Tree
  * Partial implementation of the typical BST API
