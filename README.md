# Data Structures/Algorithms

Simple interactive demo of some data structures using React/Redux. Currently there is an implementation of a Binary Search Tree only.

This project customizes some code from https://codepen.io/beaucarnes/pen/ryKvEQ?editors=0011.
It makes use of https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app.
